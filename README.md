FiveM-Path (Bypass) Script - Strictly Educational Use Only

This script is a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) tool and is provided solely for educational and research purposes, specifically to help security professionals understand and mitigate such attacks. The vulnerability this script exploits was reported to Path.net two weeks ago, and it should have been patched by now. My obligation was fulfilled by responsibly disclosing this issue.

Legal Disclaimer: I explicitly disclaim any responsibility for the misuse of this script. DDoS attacks are illegal under numerous laws, and unauthorized use of this script may lead to severe legal consequences, including criminal charges. This script is intended only for legal and ethical uses, such as testing in environments where you have explicit permission and for the purpose of responsible security research.

Relevant legal frameworks include:

*United States: The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) makes it illegal to intentionally cause damage to protected computers without authorization, including through DDoS attacks. Sharing tools used for such activities could also be considered aiding and abetting a crime.

*European Union: Under the Directive 2013/40/EU on attacks against information systems, it is illegal to intentionally access or cause harm to information systems, which includes the use of DDoS tools. The sharing of such tools for unlawful purposes can also lead to criminal liability.

By using this script, you agree that any illegal activity involving this tool is entirely your responsibility, and I shall not be held liable for any consequences that arise from such misuse. You must ensure that your use of this script is fully compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. Unauthorized or malicious use of this tool may result in severe legal action.

This script should only be used in environments where explicit permission has been granted for testing, and for educational purposes to prevent and defend against DDoS attacks.
